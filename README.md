Lab. #1

This repository respons for First Laboratory Work on Third Semester of education in MEPhI

Theme: algorithms of sorting on a polymorphic structure "Sequence". 

In this work are few (5) alg. of sorting:
  - Bubble sort;
  - Insertion sort;
  - Simple Selecetion sort;
  - Shell sort;
  - Quick sort;
  
Every algorithme can get Comparasion function (bool) Comp(T, T) and Sequence<T>* seq; (It can be used for different types of sorting and input data)
As result of working, you get:
  - Sorting time;
  - Number of sorted elements;
  - Number of comparasions;
  - Number of iterations (swaps);
  
Programm has only Console visualisation.
